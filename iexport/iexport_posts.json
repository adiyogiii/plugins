If you recognize this post, it is because these are blocks that have been converted from the classic <em>Markup: Image Alignment<\/em> post. The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let's get started. Be sure to try it in RTL mode. Left should stay left and right should stay right for both reading directions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the topic of alignment, it should be noted that users can choose from the options of <em>None<\/em>, <em>Left<\/em>, <em>Right, <\/em>and <em>Center<\/em>. If the theme has added support for <em>align wide<\/em>,&nbsp;images can also be <em>wide<\/em> and <em>full width<\/em>. Be sure to test this page in RTL mode.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, they also get the options of the image dimensions 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% or a set width and height.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":906} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/graphql\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/image-alignment-580x300-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image Alignment 580x300\" class=\"wp-image-906\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The image above happens to be <em><strong>centered<\/strong><\/em>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":904} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/graphql\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/03\/image-alignment-150x150-1.jpg\" alt=\"Image Alignment 150x150\" class=\"wp-image-904\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150x150 image, which is <em><strong>left aligned<\/strong><\/em>. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.
